## Introduction
Infodemics (infodemics.com) is a risk communication platform which works on the premise that the use of social circles in the dissemination of information makes for the most efficient and effective communication.

At Infodemics, we believe that the management of epidemics first of all begins with a definition of a location context. This is important to determine:

* where resources are to be channeled to

* what languages communication would be expressed in

* which possible collaboration is possible:
	* with the location based government
	* non-government parties and others which go into a successful risk communication plan

We then organise the risk communication effort into what we term **circles**. A circle is a group of people, sharing a common characteristic, skill or function which coordinate the risk communication effort.

Finally, we then communicate risk using our inbuilt media channels which include SMS, email, Interactive Voice Response (IVR) among others.

This manual will help users get acquainted with the application and help navigate easily.

### Sign up

![Infodemics logo](./assets/img/signup.png)

The **Log In**  button at the top right hand corner will let you log in or sign up to Infodemics. There are two ways you can sign up to use Infodemics:

* provide a valid phone number and email
* signup using Google, Twitter or Facebook accounts

Please note that when providing phone numbers, you would have to select your country and then your phone number with out the leading "0". For instance, a Nigerian with a typical *080x* number would choose Nigeria (+234) and then enter their number as *80x*.

### Log in

Log in is either using your registered phone number of the use of your Google, Twitter or Facebook accounts.

### Forgot Password

By selecting the *Forgot Password?* link while trying to log in, you will be presented with the password recovery window.

We have password recovery options available for accounts which have registered with a valid phone number. A code will be sent to you to use in the recovery process.

### Setup

Once you have successfully signed up, Infodemics will present you with a few recommended circles you can join. This is purely optional but it is a good way to begin to be exposed to the many features of the platform.

### Navbar
You can always quickly navigate using the navigation bar (navbar). 

![Infodemics logo](./assets/img/navbar.png)

The Infodemics icon on the left will always take you to the feed. The other icons on the right are:

* a button to take you to your activity feed
* a profile icon to take you to your profile and
* an exit button to log out of the application

Note that these might look slightly different if you use Infodemics on a mobile phone.

## Profile

The Infodemics user profile shows a summary of the user activities with quick links to do other user specific activities.
